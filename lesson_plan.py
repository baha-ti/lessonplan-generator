        {f'''
        REGULAR LESSON REQUIREMENTS:
        1. Adherence to Existing Conditions:
           - Strictly follow all existing lesson plan conditions
           - Maintain the provided learning activity exactly as specified
           - Ensure grade-level appropriateness
           - Follow established lesson plan structure
           - Adhere to curriculum standards

        2. Single-Discipline Focus:
           - Maintain content strictly within a single discipline
           - DO NOT introduce any interdisciplinary elements
           - Focus on depth of understanding within the specific subject
           - Develop subject-specific skills and knowledge

        3. Real-life Examples and Activities:
           - Integrate relevant real-life examples specific to the discipline
           - Ensure examples are age-appropriate and contextually relevant
           - Include practical activities that demonstrate real-world applications
           - Use examples students can easily relate to

        4. Validation and Adjustment:
           - Validate that all content strictly matches teacher-provided activity, specified grade level, single-discipline focus
           - Immediately adjust if the lesson deviates

        5. Stage-Specific Requirements:
           - INTRODUCTION:
             • Engage with discipline-specific content
             • Use real-world examples
             • Set clear learning objectives
           - COMPETENCE DEVELOPMENT:
             • Develop subject-specific knowledge with guided practice
           - DESIGN:
             • Deepen understanding of the subject
             • Include practice exercises with feedback
           - REALISATION:
             • Final tasks that demonstrate subject mastery
             • Evaluate subject-specific understanding

        6. Assessment Criteria Format:
           - Strictly reflect the tasks students perform
           - If a student task is to define a function, the criterion is: a function is defined
           - All in passive present tense, no qualifiers like 'correctly' or 'properly'

        7. Return the plan in JSON format with:
           • "Main_Learning_Activity"
           • "Specific_Learning_Activities" with sub-activities
           • "Lesson_Plan" with IDDR + 5E stages
           • "Remarks" as a single list

        {f'''
        PROJECT-BASED LESSON REQUIREMENTS:
        1. Design an extended, hands-on project that spans multiple sessions
        2. Include clear project goals, deliverables, and success criteria
        3. Incorporate student choice and autonomy
        4. Focus on problem-solving and critical thinking
        5. Use rubrics for project assessment
        6. Real-world applications and connections
        7. Collaboration and teamwork

        The lesson plan should follow the IDDR model and 5E's approach:
        1. Introduction (Engage) - Variation Principle: CONTRAST
        2. Competence Development (Explore/Explain) - Variation Principle: SEPARATION
        3. Design (Elaborate) - Variation Principle: GENERALIZATION
